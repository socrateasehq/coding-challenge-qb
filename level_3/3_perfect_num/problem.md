## Problem Statement

Write a program to print perfect numbers in a given range from 1 to n.

**Explanation**

Perfect Number is a number whose sum of factors is the same number, excluding itself.

F.e.: 6 is a perfect number. Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3

Sum of the factors `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`

Here, 6 is equal to sum so output is `1` s

## Input

The input must be an integer N.

`N > 1`

## Output

The output must print the perfect numbers from 1 to N. It should be a string of numbers separated by space.

**Example**

Input: 200
Output: 6 28

## User Task

You task is to complete `solution()` which accepts an integer and returns the expected answer. You don't need to read the input as a string, just write code within the function block directly.
