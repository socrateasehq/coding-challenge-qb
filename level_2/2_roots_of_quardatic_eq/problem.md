## Problem Statement

Write a program to find roots of quadratic equation in the form ax2 + bx + c where a, b & c are integer numbers. The equation will always yield integer roots.

## Example

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1 4 3 | -1 -3  |
| 1 2 1 | -1 -1  |

**Explanation**

If input is 1 4 3 then a = 1, b = 4 & c = 3 for quadratic equation in the form ax2 + bx + c

## Input

The input must be a string of space separated integers.

Example: 1 4 3

## Output

The input must be a string of space separated integers.

Example: -1 -3

## User Task

You task is to complete `solution()` which accepts an integer and returns the expected answer. You don't need to read the input as a string, just write code within the function block directly.
